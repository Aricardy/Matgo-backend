# REMOVED MOCK/SAMPLE DATA FROM FRONTEND

Date: July 31, 2025

## Files and Data Removed

### /src/app/receipt/sample/page.tsx
- Removed entire `fareData` object (hardcoded route/pricing/sample images).
- Removed fallback sample data logic (using fareData and URL params for mock receipt info).
- Receipt page now only uses backend data.

## Next Steps
- All other pages with mock/sample/static data will be cleaned and documented here as well.
